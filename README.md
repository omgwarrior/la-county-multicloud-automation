# LA County - Multi-Cloud Automation Framework

This repository contains a standardized Ansible framework for provisioning and managing resources across a hybrid-cloud environment, including VMWare, AWS, Azure, and GCP.

2.  **Cloud SDKs/Libraries:**
    * AWS: `boto3` and `botocore` (`pip install boto3 botocore`)
    * VMWare: `PyVmomi` (`pip install PyVmomi`)
3.  **Cloud Credentials:** Ensure your AWS (`~/.aws/credentials`) and other cloud provider credentials are configured correctly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
